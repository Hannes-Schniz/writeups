# writeups
Writeups talking about different topics. Be it technical or otherwise.

This Repo collects different writeups to various topics. There will be a mix of English and German (which is my native language). 

The writeups will be published in a markdown format using markdown (not wiki links sorry to all Obsidian users) links to link between pages.

Main topics will be:
- Linux/Open Source Projects
- Selfhosting
- Note taking (Obsidian is my weapon of choice)
- IT Trends
- Public Services (for Example public Transport)
- IT Security [For more Information](https://github.com/Hannes-Schniz/Security_Resources)
